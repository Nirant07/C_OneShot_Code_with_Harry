// Problem Statement: Write a C program that declares an integer variable `a`, assigns it a value of 6, 
// and then prints the value of `a`.

#include<stdio.h>

int main(){
    int a;
    a = 6;
    printf("the output of this code is %d",a);
    return 0;
}

// Working of the Code:
// The program begins by declaring an integer variable `a`.
// The variable `a` is then assigned the value 6.
// The value of `a` is printed using `printf` with the format specifier `%d` to display the integer value.
// The program ends with `return 0;`, which indicates successful execution.
